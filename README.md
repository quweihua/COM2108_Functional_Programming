# COM2108_Functional_Programming
COM2108-Functional Programming in The University of Sheffield in 2021fall/2022spring, Professor was Dr. Emma Norling during that time, and this assignment is Grading Assessment [^1] of COM2108. 

`sol.hs` and `SolitairePt1.pdf` were handed out by Emma, which were the start of this assignment. And `Report Submission Version.pdf` and `Solitaire_Submission_Version.hs` were my effort that handin back to Emma.

This assignment focused on using Haskell to build frameworks for various Solitaire card games. The assignment emphasizes data type definition, basic functionality implementation, and the development of functions for specific games like Eight-Off and Spider Solitaire. It challenges students to understand and translate game rules into functional programming concepts, highlighting the importance of individual work and logical thinking in developing a deeper understanding and application skills in functional programming. This task is a key educational component for fostering advanced competency in the field. 
本项作业是关于函数式编程的课程作业，旨在通过Haskell编程语言构建不同变体的纸牌接龙游戏框架。作业重点在于定义数据类型、实现基础功能，并针对特定接龙游戏如Eight-Off和Spider Solitaire，设计相应函数。此作业不仅要求学生理解和转化游戏规则，还要求能够运用函数式编程的概念，体现在个人独立工作和逻辑思维能力的培养上。这是培养学生在函数式编程领域深入理解和应用能力的关键教学环节。


[^1]: At The University of Sheffield, some modules are evaluated by Threshold Assessment and Grading Assessment. Students will get 40% of this module (which is the 'pass' score of undergraduate students) if they can get 80% in the Threshold Assessment, and the rest 60% will be evaluated by the Grading Assessment. For example, the students get 85% at the Threshold Assessment, he/she has got 40% of this module already, and he/she gets 50% in the Grading Assessment, so his/her final grade of this module will be 40 + 50 * 60% = 70 in this module.
